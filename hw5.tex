\begin{problem}[18]
Suppose $a_0,...,a_{n-1} \in \textbf{C}$. Find the minimal and characteristic polynomials of the operator on $\textbf{C}^n$ whose matrix (with respect to the standard basis) is
$$\begin{pmatrix}
0  &   &        &  &   & -a_0  \\
1  & 0 &        &  &   & -a_1 \\
   & 1 & \ddots &  & 	  &  -a_2  \\
   &   & \ddots &  &   & \vdots  \\
